# BluetoothIgnoreRedial
A modification of https://github.com/nerfherder/BluetoothGoogleNow, changed so that instead of initiating Google Now, a bluetooth redial
is completely ignored.

My bluetooth headphones have a power button that's unreliable, and sends the redial command when it shouldn't. This is to scratch my own
itch.
